Sodoku Puzzle Solver in Java 

DESCRIPTION: 
It's purpose is to randomly generate easy to moderately difficult Sodoku puzzles
and solve them. 

BACKGROUND:
I wrote this program from the ground up. I created the system for the grid, the number placement, the array handlers, the random puzzle generator, and developed algorithms for solving (easy to medium) puzzles. I am in the process of implimenting recursive algorithms to solve all difficulties of puzzles.
